1. Add auto and joystick mode and program an interchange between them.

2. Add stochasticity in enviroment. (For given action car changes the state according to some noise)
	While adding stochasticity, it should be added to actuators or observations? --> Gaussian Noise??

3. Make stochastic policy return probability distribution over actions and how confident it is on that distribution?

--> actual changes given by driver is very few than data collected.
--> There is no idea of episode or goal in this setup. Will that be necessary?
